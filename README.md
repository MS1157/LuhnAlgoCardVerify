# LuhnAlgoCardVerify
C++ implementation of the Luhn algorithm for validating credit/ATM card numbers. Ensures basic card number integrity through checksum verification. Simple, efficient, and easy to integrate.
## Description
The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, and national identification numbers. This implementation in C++ provides a function that takes a string representation of a number as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm.
This project is useful for:
* Learning about the Luhn algorithm.
* Integrating basic card number validation into C++ applications.
* Understanding string manipulation and basic arithmetic in C++.
### Prerequisites
* A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
* A basic understanding of C++
